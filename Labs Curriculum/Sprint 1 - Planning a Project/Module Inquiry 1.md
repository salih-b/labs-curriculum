# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?

    a. Is it up to us to determine what statistics to show, or are there set ones you (the stakeholder) wants?
    (rent, weather, job industry. The rest is up to us)
    b. Requirements for cities to be included? are we also including greater areas/ are larger cities split up
    (cities with more than 50k, Include suburban areas, Do not split large cities at first)
    c. Do you have any data for us or any sources/ is there an existing codebase
    (no)
    d. Is there a preference for how the data is displayed to the user
    (up to us)

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.

    a. signup/login
    b. filter by stats
    c. searh by city
    d. select city or cities
    e. view city stats
    f. compare cities
    g. save city to favorites

3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?

    - view city stats - 
    tasks: 
        need to scrape data
        Endpoint to collect the data
        need to organize data 
        Frontend / User option, to view each type of data on a city
    I connected everything from bakend to front end well, breaking it down further without having anything infornt of me is a bit challenging. 

4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

    I would break down individual tasks by first thinking of what needs to be completed before anyhting else can be touched, complete those prerequisites first then work from there till the task is complete.
